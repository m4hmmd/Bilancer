# Bilancer

This Android app is an online platform for university students for finding and/or offering help in their courses or getting together studying before exams, quizzes etc. Although the initial idea had only the university courses, there is no reason not to seek help in anything different, like cooking, or playing an instrument.

## Current Version
Here are some things that need to be improved or fixed:
* Add a 'back' button to every activity
* Revise User.class
* Add ProgressBars (loading... etc)
